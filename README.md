# IoT-temperature-sensor-with-ESP32-and-REACT
This IoT temperature sensor project is built with the following three elements.

1. A sensor node for temperature sensing using ESP32 and ds18x20 temperature sensor. Used micropython on sensor node. 
2. A web server (NodeJS, Express) which connects to the sensor node and fetches temperature data periodically.
3. A web application (using REACT) which fetches temperature data from web server and creates a temperature data plot.
